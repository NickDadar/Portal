# ACH Standard Entry Class (SEC) Codes 

Each ACH application has a unique Standard Entry Class (SEC) Code that identifies a single ACH debit used by an Originator for the conversion of an eligible source document received via the U.S. mail or delivery service, at a lockbox location, or in person at a manned location for the payment of a bill. 

The SEC Code generally indicates:

- The nature of the transaction as consumer or corporate in nature (i.e., whether the funds transfer affects a consumer account or a corporate account at the RDFI). 
- Whether the transaction is single-entry or recurring.
- The specific computer record format that will be used to carry the payment and payment-related information relevant to the application.
